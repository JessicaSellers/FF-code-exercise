# Overview

This application allows a user to input a word or multiple words (separated by spaces) and analyzes the word(s) to try to find common suffixes. If a common suffix is found the application removes the suffix and may add back letters based on the provided grammar rules then displays it for the user. If a common suffix is not found, the application assumes this word is a root word and displays it for the user. The user can see a table of the root words found based on the words they have entered during that user session. They may remove the word from the table using the remove button.
